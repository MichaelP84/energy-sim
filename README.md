# started working with pycachism to simulate the caches, the only issue is according to the assigment: "The L1 cache is direct mapped and has a 32KB for instructions and 32KB for data"
# it is not straight forward to hook up 2 separate l1 chaces to the same l2 case, so I decided to write the cache class myself


# to install pycacheism in case you want to look: cd pycacheism && pip install .
# main.py and exmaples.py: pyacheism
# mycache.py: from scratch
